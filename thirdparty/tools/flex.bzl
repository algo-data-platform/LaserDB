"""Build rule for generating C or C++ sources with Flex.

IMPORTANT: we _strongly recommend_ that you include a unique and project-
specific `%option prefix="myproject"` directive in your scanner spec to avoid
very hard-to-debug symbol name conflict problems if two scanners are linked
into the same dynamically-linked executable.

By default, flex includes the definition of a static function `yyunput` in its
output. If you never use the lex `unput` function in your lex rules, however,
`yyunput` will never be called. This causes problems building the output file,
as llvm issues warnings about static functions that are never called. To avoid
this problem, use `%option nounput` in the declarations section if your lex
rules never use `unput`.

Note that if you use the c++ mode of flex, you will need to include the
boilerplate header `FlexLexer.h` file in any `cc_library` which includes the
generated flex scanner directly.  This is typically done by
`#include <FlexLexer.h>` which typically is installed in /usr/include
when flex is installed.

Examples
--------

This is a simple example.
```
genlex(
    name = "html_lex_lex",
    src = "html.lex",
    out = "html_lexer.c",
)
```

This example uses a `.tab.hh` file.
```
genlex(
    name = "rules_l",
    src = "rules.lex",
    includes = [
        "rules.tab.hh",
    ],
    out = "rules.yy.cc",
)
```
